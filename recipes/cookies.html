        <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3>
        <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies of your life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda: </strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Water: </strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Chips: </strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts (optional): </strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>
